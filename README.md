# Graduate Admission Predictor

This project aims in helping students in shortlisting universities with their profiles. The predicted output gives them a fair idea (percentage out of 100) about their chances for a particular university.

## Source

This dataset is taken from kaggle for Self Learning. \

In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'target variable') and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', or 'features'). 

The following Regression models were used :

1. Linear Regression.
2. Decision Tree Regression
3. Random Forest Regression.
4. K-Neighbors Regression
5. Support Vector Regression
6. XGB Regression


## Learning Outcome

1. During creating this model, I learnt how to analyse data using correlation between them, how to detect outliers if present in the data.
2. Model Selection and Deep understanding of various Regression Models was developed.

## Usage

1. Download the following files and keep them in a same folder.
    *  [model.pkl](https://github.com/shubhamjain02/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Graduate-Admission-Predictor/model.pkl)
    *  [app.py](https://github.com/shubhamjain02/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Graduate-Admission-Predictor/app.py)
    *  [style.css](https://github.com/shubhamjain02/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Graduate-Admission-Predictor/static/style.css)
    *  [index.html](https://github.com/shubhamjain02/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Graduate-Admission-Predictor/template/index.html)

2. Open Annaconda Prompt in your computer and set the working directory as the folder which contain your files.

3. Execute **python app.py** .
